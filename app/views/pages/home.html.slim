            p Simply saying to yourself, “I am done for good” is nothing more than you talking to yourself. You need to physically invest in quitting. To use DropQuit, you must bet $20 or more per week on your quit. For each week that you stay solid, you will earn points that can be redeemed for real stuff.

            p The last step is Daily Roll call. To replace one bad habit, we must form an opposing good one. Every day, you will make an oath to the DropQuit community that you will not use any form of tobacco that day. This is the lifeblood of your quit and is required to complete the program.
